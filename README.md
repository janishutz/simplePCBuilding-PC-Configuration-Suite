# simplePCBuilding-PC-Configuration-Suite
You are just starting out to build a PC but you don't know how to configure that PC? This Software allows you to do exactly that. 

# This software will most likely use ML in a future version. 
I am currently working on other projects as to why this repo doesn't see any contributions. I will also most likely not offer the training data & trained model for free. You may create your own training data and train the models yourself using the codebase here (once it is available). This is due to the fact that it takes a lot of time to create the training data for such an AI.
